I implemented a web server in C that loads web page on a specified port by the user. I supported two HTTP request methods => GET, POST

To run:
gcc server.c && ./a.out port_number

Then go to browser and type:
localhost:port_number

To send a POST request, open a terminal and type:
  (echo -en "POST /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\nConnection: Keep-alive
  \r\n\r\nPOSTDATA") | nc 127.0.0.1 port_number
  
Substitute port_number with your chosen port number for the server
